# SepiWoogieEval
The notebook files which were used to perform evaluation on the test set of the SepiWoogie audio source separation task. You need the dataset first before you can perform any type of evaluation. The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/burekpapi/sepiwoogie 

The evaluation consists of two Python Notebook files, namely eval_run.ipynb and eval_analysis.ipynb. Run the former first to get estimations on performance of different audio source separation methods on the test set of SepiWoogie. The second file is used to perform statistical analysis on the results. 

A retrained version of Open-Unmix was also evaluated against the test set. The code of UMX can be found here: https://github.com/sigsep/open-unmix-pytorch
